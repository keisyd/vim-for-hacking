Using Applets (simple automated statements that are triggered by\nchanges in other web services), IFTTT creates new connections of all types.\nThese connections can, for example, automate a suite of simple life tasks or\ntransform how someone interacts with and controls their home, including\nadjusting the thermostat or lighting. IFTTT works with over 500 apps, services,\nand devices, such as Facebook, Twitter, Philips Hue, Dropbox, Google, Nest,\nFitbit, BMW, and Slack. Millions of people use IFTTT, and over a billion Applets\nare run every month.\n\nUber is a popular requested service by IFTTT’s users — not only across their\ncurrent user base, but also with commuters, travelers, and many other potential\ncustomer segments. Many of IFTTT’s customers also live in urban environments\nwhere owning a car isn’t necessary, and Uber has become a convenient option. For\nboth reasons, IFTTT was interested in creating an Uber integration that enhances\nthe ride experience for these passengers.\n\nLights, Thermostat, Automation!\n\nIFTTT’s Uber service\n[https:\u002F\u002Fifttt.com\u002Fuber?utm_medium=Email&utm_source=Uber&utm_campaign=Uber_Developer&utm_term=Blog_Post&utm_content=] \nleverages the Trip Experiences API\n[https:\u002F\u002Fdeveloper.uber.com\u002Fdocs\u002Ftrip-experiences\u002Fintroduction] to run events\nwhen the ride is arriving, starting, and completed. Uber riders authenticate\nwith the IFTTT application, so IFTTT can use webhooks to get certain data such\nas new trips, state changes, and destination. What really took the API\nintegration to the next level was the ability to customize the applet\nexperiences using the contextual data provided by the trip alias\n[https:\u002F\u002Fdeveloper.uber.com\u002Fdocs\u002Friders\u002Freferences\u002Fapi\u002Fv1.2\u002Fplaces-place_id-get]\n. With aliases, riders can run specific Applets for when they’re heading to or\nfrom their home or work via a trip requested by Uber. The combined trip data\nmeans the service is incredibly flexible, and makes it easy to create practical\nApplets. The most popular Uber Applets launched thus far are:\n\n+ Blink your lights when your Uber is arriving\n[https:\u002F\u002Fifttt.com\u002Fapplets\u002FKP3bjune-blink-your-lights-when-your-uber-is-arriving]\n\n+ Turn off your lights when you leave home in an Uber\n[https:\u002F\u002Fifttt.com\u002Fapplets\u002FR8iDZT2h-turn-off-your-lights-when-you-leave-your-home-in-an-uber]\n\n+ Log your completed rides in Google Calendar\n[https:\u002F\u002Fifttt.com\u002Fapplets\u002FBgRhBCyv-log-your-completed-rides-in-google-calendar]\n\n+ When you’re on your way home, set your Nest thermostat\n[https:\u002F\u002Fifttt.com\u002Fapplets\u002Fq2FtiLCe-when-you-re-on-your-way-home-set-your-nest-thermostat]\n\n+ Log your completed Uber trips in a Google spreadsheet\n[https:\u002F\u002Fifttt.com\u002Fapplets\u002FA7cE2uYX-log-your-completed-uber-trips-in-a-spreadsheet]\n\n+ Let someone know you’re on your way home\n[https:\u002F\u002Fifttt.com\u002Fapplets\u002Fyb46C9Mc-let-someone-know-you-re-on-your-way-home]\n\n“We launched the Uber service in July, and we’re excited to see what our users\ndo with it.

It’s still in the early days, but IFTTT is eager to see the\nmany new ways riders will connect to Uber. Will riders use the service with\ncommunication tools like email and chat to let people know when they’re on the\nway? Will they find new ways to get notified or notify others about their rides?\nOr will they come up with creative ideas we didn’t even anticipate?\n\nUnique services like Uber also act as gateways to new audiences. For example, in\naddition to connecting with Uber’s rider base, IFTTT is also thinking of how\nApplets can enhance the driving experience for Uber’s driver-partners. In the\ncoming months, IFTTT plans to keep its ears to the ground for cool applet ideas\nthat unlock new automation possibilities using the Uber Driver API\n[https:\u002F\u002Fdeveloper.uber.com\u002Fdocs\u002Fdrivers\u002Fintroduction].\n\n“As a huge fan and daily user of IFTTT, I am incredibly excited about this\ncollaboration.

Think of calendar events with destinations or commute schedules as\nexamples. Bixby captures these intents and surfaces an appropriate card. The\ncard shows information, such as time and destination.

This is Alice’s first time working\nindependently.\n\nAlice knows that, as an independent worker, taxes won’t be withheld\nautomatically from her earnings, and heard from a friend that she should be\nsetting aside about 30% to cover her tax bill. Then using Stride to track her\nearnings and business expenses, Alice found that she only needs to set aside\nabout 9% of her earnings for taxes — 21 percentage points less than she\nexpected. To date, driver partners like Alice have used Stride to claim more\nthan $60M in tax deductions, reducing their taxable income and helping them keep\nmore of their earnings.\n\nHere’s how this is possible: A 30% effective tax rate is a commonly used\nrule-of-thumb for independent contractors. This rate combines federal, state,\nand self-employment taxes, while making some assumptions about household size\nand income bracket.\n\nBut 30% of earnings is far more than Alice should be paying in taxes. What\nAlice, her friend, and most other driver partners don’t realize is the \njaw-dropping amount of money they can save in taxes by deducting business\nexpenses and miles driven for work. As an independent contractor, Alice can\nactually claim tax deductions for many of her day-to-day expenses: The miles she\nputs on her car, the new phone and car holder she’ll need, her monthly health\ninsurance premium, and her weekly car wash to name a few. Most driver partners\nsimply aren’t aware of everything they can deduct\n[http:\u002F\u002Fblog.stridehealth.com\u002Fpost\u002Frideshare-tax-deduction-guide?utm_source=uber&utm_campaign=uberapipost&utm_medium=blog]\n.\n\nThe financial impact for driver partners who track these deductions is\nsignificant. In a recent survey\n[http:\u002F\u002Fblog.stridehealth.com\u002Fpost\u002Fstride-drive-report-2016?rq=most%20drivers],\nwe found that driver partners who track these business expenses don’t need to\nset aside anywhere close to 30%. In fact, the typical driver partner using our\nmileage and expense tracking app Stride Drive\n[http:\u002F\u002Fstridedrive.com\u002F?utm_source=uber&utm_campaign=uberapipost&utm_medium=blog] \ncan easily claim so many deductions that they owe just 8.7%. Compared to what\ndriver partners who don’t track expenses would owe, their tax rate is 21\npercentage points lower — keeping significantly more money in their pockets. \nThat’s huge.\n\nHelping driver partners see the financial impact of tracking deductions\nMost driver partners don’t track their business deductions. People think it\ntakes too much effort or time, and don’t realize how much it can impact their\nbottom line.\n\nThat’s why Stride built the Tax Calculator\n[https:\u002F\u002Fwww.stridehealth.com\u002Fdrive\u002Fuber-1099-tax-calculator?utm_source=uber&utm_campaign=uberapipost&utm_medium=blog]\n. With just a few clicks, Stride shows driver partners how much they should\nexpect to owe in taxes and how much they could stand to gain from tracking more\ndeductions.\n\nAs our CEO Noah Lang describes it, “Stride’s partnership with Uber is an\nunrivaled opportunity for us to deeply integrate products to serve driver\npartners throughout the year. I’m especially excited about how we’re using the\nUber Driver API to provide any driver partner the simplest way to estimate their\nexpected taxes.”\n\nHow we built the Tax Calculator using the Uber Driver API\nStride uses the Uber Driver API [https:\u002F\u002Fdeveloper.uber.com\u002Fdocs\u002Fdrivers] to\nretrieve an entire year’s worth of earnings and trips data for a driver partner.\nThe Tax Calculator parses apart the various payments, removes basic deductions\nlike fees and on-trip mileage, and gives each driver partner a simple tax\nsummary of their earnings and estimated taxes.\n\nIn order to generate each driver partner’s annual tax estimate in real-time\n(10–15 seconds), we parallelize pulling data from the \u002Fpartners\u002Fpayments\n[https:\u002F\u002Fdeveloper.uber.com\u002Fdocs\u002Fdrivers\u002Freferences\u002Fapi\u002Fv1\u002Fpartners-payments-get] \nand \u002Fpartners\u002Ftrips\n[https:\u002F\u002Fdeveloper.uber.com\u002Fdocs\u002Fdrivers\u002Freferences\u002Fapi\u002Fv1\u002Fpartners-trips-get] \nendpoints to aggregate annual earnings data including incentives and referral\npayments, remove on-trip mileage deductions, and unify the result to present it\nin a way that’s helpful to the driver partners.\n\nYear-round, we’re showing driver partners how much of their earnings they should\nset aside, so when tax time comes around, driver partners are financially\nprepared and understand how to keep more of their earnings.\n\nWe’re thrilled about this first integration with Uber’s Driver API.
